What did you like about this website?
    I am also a powerlifter so I enjoyed the site because Michael provides people with all the information they might possibly need to get started with powerlifting. I really like how he broke up the tabs into the different lifts that we do in powerlifting and provided them each their own little area of experitise. As well as the Last question on the Q&A page haha.
Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. 
    One big difference between Michaels and my own is that Michaels nav bar is more bare bones where I put a little more into it. Besides that our sites are similar. I also don't mean "bare bones" in a bad way, I think it absolutely fits the aesthetic of powerlifting and is exactly what I imagine powerlifting pages looking like. They like it simple.
    Which has a better user experience (and why)?
        Both user experiences are nice, I found no problems with his user experience and I think both of ours are very usable.
    Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
        I think our code bases are fairly similar. It would depend on what you value in a code base. If you prefer to have more spacing and a more "lines" of code, Michaels is the way to go. He has it set out nicely and very informative but inherently that causes it to be longer. I feel that mine is shorter and a little more concise but also has appropriate tags and looks good as well. 
Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    Yes, the code is structured well.
Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    I did not find any big issues, very good work!
    were semantically appropriate elements selected
        Yes, very informative.
    is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
        Yes, he even has CSS for small screens.
Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    Great work, love the website!
